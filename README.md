# RoboSprint Arena Simulator

The aim of this project is to create a virtual arena to test algorithms for robot path planning.
The motivation for this project was to have an environment that mimics the robot's behavior in a RoboSprint competition i.e. receiving commands from remote computer and moving in a straight line and at an angle.

This project uses processing graphical library for drawing and animating objects.
